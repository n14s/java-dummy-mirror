# Blink-Break

Give your eyes a break. \
A small script to remember to rest your eyes for a while. \
Look outside. There's a bird sitting in the tree.

# Motivation

The eye is a central organ for the modern human.\
It's constantly working, especially if your profession or lifestyle requires you to look at a screen for a long time on a regular basis.
Eye pain and dry eyes are the result.

[The 20-20-20 rule](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule) is a method to tackle this problem.\
It states, that every 20 minutes one should focus something, that it (at least) 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

While not hard or time-consuming to implement in one's daily life and while working well with likes of the [pomodoro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique), it can be merely forgotten until the physical consequences are encountered.

# Goal

The goal is to make a PR with a subtle change
Nothing to see here

# Usage

Simply make the script executable by running \
`chmod +x blink-break`, \
 \
then execute the script by running \
`./blink-break`.

# Autostart

It can be liberating not having to start the script on every login.\

Let your machine start this script on boot, by adding it to autostart in the system settings. \

In Ubuntu, set autostart for blink-break under: setting manager > session and startup > application autostart.
